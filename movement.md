# Movement
[AverageTrey's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oudZMniib08) on the any% category is what first opened my eyes to speedrunning as a whole. I was immediately captivated by the fast and intense movement present in top level play and decided then and there to try it out (although it took me like 3 years to actually get started).

SMS is a hard game. The movement allows for intense gameplay and there's plenty of tech and other nuances that are difficult to notice unless you have someone else explain them to you. This page aims to serve as a glossary for general movement, tech, bugs etc. that will be usefull to know.

This page assumes you are using a gamecube controller. If you don't, then you are probably a 3DAS or Dolphin user. Ain't nothin' wrong with that, I just happen to not give a shit.
